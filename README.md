# Cozy Notes App 🍂
> _“Autumn carries more gold in its pocket than all the other seasons.” — Jim Bishop_

A cute and cozy sticky notes app built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://react.dev/).  
Take notes, jot down to-dos, and keep your autumn vibes strong!

**Note:** This is my very first project using JavaScript and React! I’m learning as I go, so feedback and ideas are always welcome.

## 🥇 Persistent Notes (localStorage)

This app uses your browser’s **localStorage** to save notes.  
Your sticky notes will still be there if you close or refresh the page, or come back later—on both computer and mobile!  
Notes are private and stored only on your device.
